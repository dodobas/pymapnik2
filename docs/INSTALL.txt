mapnik Installation
======================================

To install mapnik into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:



Prerequisites
-------------------

Don't forget that you can play with LDFLAGS/CFLAGS/LD_LIBRARY_PATH dto indicate non standart locations for the following requirements if it applies.


You will have to have the includes and libraries for

    - Boost_python linked to your python interpreter
    - cairo / cairomm
    - mapnik
    - The current python interpreter

Easy_install
--------------

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install mapnik``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:

Buildout
----------

 * Add ``mapnik`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.

::

    [buildout]


    [somepart]
    recipe)someEggInstallerRecipe
    ...
    (options like include dirs)
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        mapnik
