mapnik Installation
======================================
Prerequisites
-------------------

Don't forget that you can play with LDFLAGS/CFLAGS/LD_LIBRARY_PATH dto indicate non standart locations for the following requirements if it applies.


You will have to have the includes and libraries for

    - Boost_python linked to your python interpreter
      If it is not installed in standart envionments, you ll have to handle the CFLAGS/LDFLAGS to find it, or use minitage ;)
    - cairo / cairomm (optionnal)
    - mapnik
    - The current python interpreter

Easy_install
--------------

* When you're reading this you have probably already run
  ``easy_install mapnik``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:

Buildout
----------

* Add ``mapnik`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.

::

    [buildout]

    [somepart]
    recipe)someEggInstallerRecipe
    ...
    (options like include dirs)
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        mapnik

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can read the buildout installation shipped with this egg for inspiration.
Some developers use minitage_ to ease deployments.
Indeed, it takes care a lot of things like those boring compilation flags.
As an example, to work on this egg in development mode, you can boostrap it by doing this::

    # installing minitage / initiating it
    easy_install -U virtualenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute ~/minitage
    source ~/minitage/bin/activate
    minimerge -s
